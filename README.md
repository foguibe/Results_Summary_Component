# Project Readme

## Result Summary Component

The Result Summary Component project is a web page designed and developed with HTML and CSS, showcasing a range of front-end development skills. This README provides a detailed breakdown of the project's structure and the developer's proficiency in various areas.

### HTML Structure

The `index.html` file defines the structure of the web page:

1. **Document Structure**: The document adheres to the HTML5 standard with a proper document type declaration and the inclusion of essential elements.

2. **Meta Tags**: Appropriate meta tags ensure character encoding and viewport configuration.

3. **Stylesheet Link**: The external CSS file (`styles.css`) is linked to separate content from presentation.

4. **Favicon**: A favicon is added for the website icon.

5. **Content Sections**: The page is organized into a main content section and a footer, embracing semantic HTML.

6. **Responsive Images**: The project uses responsive images, including the use of the `<picture>` element to provide responsive image loading for different screen sizes.

### CSS Styling

The `styles.css` file contains CSS rules that style the web page, demonstrating several CSS skills:

1. **Box Sizing**: The universal selector (`*`) is used to set `box-sizing` to `border-box`, ensuring consistent box models.

2. **Margin Reset**: Default margins are reset to zero to control element spacing.

3. **Typography Enhancements**: Typography is improved with enhanced line height, text rendering, and the use of custom fonts, specifically 'Ubuntu.'

4. **Media Handling**: Images and media elements are configured for responsiveness with `max-width: 100%`.

5. **Form Styling**: The CSS code handles form elements, preserving consistent font styles.

6. **Text Overflow Handling**: A CSS rule ensures that text doesn't overflow its container.

7. **Flexbox Layout**: Flexbox is used for the main content, ensuring a responsive and centered layout.

8. **Background and Border Styling**: The project defines background colors, border-radius, and box-shadow for aesthetic appeal.

9. **Button Styling**: Buttons are styled with backgrounds, colors, and hover effects for an interactive user experience.

### Specific Styles

- Different text elements such as `h1`, `p`, `h3`, and `h6` are styled for consistency.

- Custom fonts, colors, and font weights are used to create an appealing visual design.

- Responsive design techniques are applied for varying screen sizes, adjusting the layout and styles accordingly using media queries.

- Interactive features like the "Continue" button are implemented with appropriate styling and hover effects.
